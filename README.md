## Trials and tribulations in the pursuit of endless automation

Any opportunity to further automate things around work don't get passed up by me, no little how meagre the savings in time offered are!
Learning something new and shaving time off repetetive tasks is a win-win in my book. 

The latest windmill that I took a tilt at was automatically generating invoices from within excel for Xero. 

Basically as a nature of our business we need to track carbon offsets sold to clients within excel spreadsheets which need to be updated at least once a quarter. Each time these are updated a pdf copy of this needs to be provided to the client along with an invoice containing details from the balance sheet.

If *only* this could all be done automatically with the click of a button. . .
